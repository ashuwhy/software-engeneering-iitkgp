Create a file with the name ROLLNO_week1_q1.cpp and write a C++ program to print numbers with the following requirement.

Ask user the start number
Print five numbers 
Ask the user again for the end number 
Print numbers until the end number
You may not use any pointers or reference in your program
You may not use any global variables
All incrementing of the number should be strictly done inside the get_num_after_increment and not anywhere else.
Use the following template:

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int get_num_after_increment(int k)
{
// You must increment only in this function.
// Do not change the signature of this function. Do not use a global variable.
}
int main()
{
// Complete this code
return 0;
}
The following is a sample run:
Enter a start: 12
12
13
14
15
16
Printed five numbers. Enter end: 26
17
18
